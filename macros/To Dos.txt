--------- To Dos:

*** 5.1 Thoughts

	- Create an event to allow users to search for settings, and change those settings on the fly
	Something that would function much like the help file, but instead give you a read-out of different settings to toggle

1. Create a default routes file, with routes from the guild lobby to common destinations

2. Set up some type of fix for 'you can use the ability X again in Y minute(s) Z seconds
	This should be easy enough to set up as event that creates a timer.

3. Fix Auto / manual toggle for loot modes

4. Fix Auto-forage ( this is very very very...very minor )

5. Add auto trade functions. Possibly auto accept trade with bots and a /bc notification when a non-bot is trading with a bot?

(To Finish)
**** drag corpses
**** Add a function to cast a buff on a given bot
